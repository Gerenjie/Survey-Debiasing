# Survey-Debiasing

This repository serves to make accessible the methods used in `A Well-Characterized HelioLinC Survey for Centaurs in Pan-STARRS1` (Kurlander 2024). The notebook `Bias Application and Multivariate Statistics.ipynb` opens and formats the survey data stored in the other files in this repo. These data include the survey's real discoveries, synthetic debiasing objects (both discovered and undiscovered), and a literature Centaur model combining the orbital Centaur model from  [Nesvorný & Vokrouhlický (2016)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/825/2/94) with the size distribution from [Lawler et al. (2018)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/aab8ff).
